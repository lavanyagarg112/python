'''
To enable the use of operators with instances of a custom class, you need to implement the corresponding special methods 
(also known as magic methods) with the exact names that Python expects. 

Here are some of the most common ones related to arithmetic and comparison operations:

- `__add__(self, other)`: for addition `+`
- `__sub__(self, other)`: for subtraction `-`
- `__mul__(self, other)`: for multiplication `*`
- `__truediv__(self, other)`: for division `/`
- `__floordiv__(self, other)`: for floor division `//`
- `__mod__(self, other)`: for modulo `%`
- `__pow__(self, other[, modulo])`: for power `**`
- `__lt__(self, other)`: for less than `<`
- `__le__(self, other)`: for less than or equal `<=`
- `__eq__(self, other)`: for equality `==`
- `__ne__(self, other)`: for inequality `!=`
- `__gt__(self, other)`: for greater than `>`
- `__ge__(self, other)`: for greater than or equal `>=`

These methods allow you to define how instances of your class should behave when used with the corresponding operators. 
If you do not implement the relevant method for an operator, trying to use that operator with instances of your class will 
raise a `TypeError`.

Inheritance in object orientation programming

1) An inheritance heirarchy for Python Collections

Sequential collections and Non sequential Collection

Lists, tuples, and strings are all examples of sequential collections. They all inherit common data organization and operations. 
However, each of them is distinct based on whether the data is homogeneous and whether the collection is immutable. 
The children all gain from their parents but distinguish themselves by adding additional characteristics.

Similarly Non sequential collection includes dictionary and sets


2) An inheritance heirarchy for Logic gates
Binary gate (And, or) and Unary gate (not)
