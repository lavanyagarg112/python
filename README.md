# Hello!
Hi everyone. I am Lavanya, a year 1 computer science student. 

# Python
I have created this repository in order to share my learnings in python, as I navigate through various courses and concepts.
I hope you will join me on this journey!

# Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python
I am currently learning DSA in python, do check out the folder on this repository.

P.S.: I am a beginner. If there are any errors in my code, I would be grateful if you would let me know!

Update: Discontinued, as I discovered other resources more relevant to my coursework as well

# Leetcode
I have recently started my leetcode journey and you can find my solutions [here](https://github.com/lavanyagarg112/leetcode)!

For the first few questions, I simply coded it out, however, realising my error, I later began to write down my notes and learnings as comments.
